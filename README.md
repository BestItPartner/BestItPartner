### How to see all repositories ðŸ‘‹
In my github, there are only some limited public sources.<br/>
But almost important sources are privates because I signed NDAs with old clients.<br/>
For more details about my all sources, I can show everything in shared screen using Google meet or Zoom.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
